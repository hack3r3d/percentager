<h1>Percentager</h1>
This is a simple WordPress plugin that calculates the percentage change between two numbers.

I created it for two reasons.

<ol>
<li>I wanted to be able to calculate the percentage change between two numbers.</li>
<li>I also wanted a simple example application to use in WordPress plugin tutorials that I write.</li>
</ol>
